# WhatsApp-chatbot
This project creates an intelligent WhatsApp-based chatbot using Twilio, Flask, and Google Gemini Pro. The chatbot accepts user queries or contact details through WhatsApp, generates structured responses or SQL queries (based on intent), and delivers formatted messages or insights directly to the CEO or backend team for action.
